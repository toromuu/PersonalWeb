        content: It is used to deploy a network of linux containers. It allows to understand how container networks work in detail. One of the mechanisms used by container systems such as Docker is the separation of namespaces, so that each container receives its own namespace for each of the named resources it has access to in the OS. Of special relevance is the network namespace, as it is not possible to properly isolate a container if it is allowed to communicate arbitrarily with any other agent in a distributed system. Containers in Linux use network namespaces to establish proper network isolation.

      - title: Pipeline CI/CD Template
        content: The project tries to cover almost all the theoretical stages of a CI/CD pipeline, starting the development in a Docker container where you will be guaranteed to be working under an identical environment for all developers. Any change made in the repository will trigger the execution of the pipeline itself. The pipeline, the different phases of the automation of the continuous integration and deployment process, will be defined and coordinated through the Jenkins tool, which is installed in a second Docker container. After receiving the change in the repository, unit tests will be executed and the quality of the code will be measured using the Sonarqube tool. Once the code has passed the testing phase, the Terraform tool will be used to provide the infrastructure for the deployment of the application, this being an instance on AWS. After contracting the server, using the Ansible tool, the server will be prepared for the deployment of the application, configuring everything necessary for the application to run. On this web server, the application will be executed and the client will be able to access it as a service from a public ip address.
